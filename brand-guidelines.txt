## **Aftertaste Brand Website — Comprehensive AI Build Guide**

You are building a website for **Aftertaste**, a social platform for reviewing and exploring **TV, film, podcasts, and music**.
The website must **look** and **sound** aligned with Aftertaste’s brand guidelines, following both the **visual identity** and **core messaging** below.

---

### **Brand Identity & Voice**

#### **Who We Are**

Aftertaste is a **trusted, community-driven hub** where people can discover and discuss the media they love.
We exist to replace noisy algorithms and scattered conversations with **meaningful recommendations** from people with similar tastes.

#### **Mission**

Provide one central, reliable place to decide what to watch or listen to next by blending:

* **Professional scores & reviews** (e.g., IMDb, Pitchfork)
* **Authentic personal recommendations** from friends, family, and creators.

#### **Personality**

* **Trustworthy:** User-first, not algorithm-first.
* **Nostalgic:** Inspired by the golden age of Hollywood.
* **Creative:** Celebrating all forms of media with visual flair.
* **Inclusive:** Welcoming to critics, creators, and casual fans alike.

#### **Tone of Voice**

* Warm, conversational, and knowledgeable.
* Avoid overly corporate or tech jargon.
* Speak like a fellow enthusiast who knows their stuff and wants to share it.

---

### **Market Context**

**Problem:**
Content is released faster than people can track. There’s no single, trustworthy space that spans multiple media types and combines professional reviews with personal trust.

**Solution:**
Centralize multiple media types (TV, film, podcasts, music) into one platform where users can connect, chat, and share recommendations — no more hopping between platforms or recalling scattered conversations.
